# exTest-Java

## exTest

exTest is the framework aimed to solved the most common problem in the software development - Testing.
exTest is actually a shortname for extensive testing. 
The framework aims to simplify the process of testing a workflow. A workflow can be a set of steps that needs to be taken to finish one action. There can be multiple variations to each of the steps to perform the action. 
To qualify that all variations of all steps leading to an action are working fine, there would be large number of permutations and combinations that needs to be tested.
The framework aims to simplify this by defining the steps and variations in the form of a matrix and performing all tests for all combinations leading to an action.
This framework helps the developer to eliminate the need to write an unit test for each combination. Once the developer defines steps and variations, the framework takes care of creating unit tests for all combinations and executing them.
